# Off The Books

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dlebech/off-the-books.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dlebech/off-the-books)

While doing something off the books is usually not a good thing, this little
app surely is.

There is not much here yet, and there might never be, but the idea is to parse
bank transaction data without storing the information in a central database
like most other apps do. This ensures privacy.

Mostly, it's just a bit of an experiment for me for now.

## Development

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
