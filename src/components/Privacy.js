      <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
      <p>We do not retain your data, since we do not have your data.</p>
      <p>If you choose to use the &quot;Save data in the browser&quot; feature, the data is stored in that specific browser as long as you have the feature enabled. Note that it is not <em>us</em> storing this data, it is <em>you</em>.</p>

      <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
      <p>You have full control over your data.</p>
      <p>Everything in the app is stored in your browser, and only in your browser. You can delete this data at any time.</p>
